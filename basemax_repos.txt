  url        : https://github.com/BaseMax/0-1KnapsackDynamicProgrammingC
  description: This is an implementation of the 0-1 knapsack problem in C using dynamic programming. The problem consists of a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to determine the subset of items that maximizes the total value of the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

  description: This is an implementation of the 0-1 knapsack problem in C using a recursive approach. The problem consists of a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to determine the subset of items that maximizes the total value of the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

  url        : https://github.com/BaseMax/01Knapsack
  description: The project focuses on solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem using various algorithms. The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a well-known optimization problem in computer science that deals with finding the best combination of items to pack into a knapsack, where each item has a weight and a value, and the knapsack has a limited capacity.
